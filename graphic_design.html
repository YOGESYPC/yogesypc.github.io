      <h2>JAVA CAFE POSTER</h2>
      <img src="./webassests/java_cafe.png" alt="Java Cafe Poster">
      <p>I have design a cafe promotion opening poster based on the 20 Century/ Contemporary design style and I used the New Millenium Style. These are items I have used in developing this poster which are for the font we use iCel-fonts for the ‘Java Cafe’, the lavenderia personal license for ‘Chill with Java Cafe, and berry rotunda font 213 for ‘Grand Opening’. I have used some picture or assests from other sources which are men drinking coffee image that can view inside the laptop screen, cup of the coffee and coding image lines that appear in laptop screen.
        I did the coffee container typography where the coffee container has been made using the geometry shape and use the envelope distort to visible the text on top of the coffee container. I insert the image in the 3D laptop using the create outlines and then choose either perspective distort or free distort to insert and adjust the coding image together with men drinking coffee image until fit the laptop screen size. I use the geometry shape where I choose the rectangular shape to fill blue color background and I draw circle for gradient color slider. Then, I will edit the position of light where I adjust the size of circle to produce as spotlight.</p>

      <img src="./webassests/paris_newspaper.jpg" alt="Paris Masthead">
      <p>I used the Adobe Illustrator and use the Chomsky text font to make this Paris word. Then I convert it to outline stroke where I set the offset path. I will swap the Fill and Stroke to make the stroke thinner. Once I have developed the Paris word, I will create the horizontal line to add it inside the Paris word. I will use the Line Segment tool and draw two line. I will blend these two lines to fill up the spaces between these two lines and convert it in compound path. Later I will intersect the most inner text (Paris) and horizontal line.These are below items are used for developing this project design..</p>

      <img src="./webassests/nasi_briyani.png" alt="Nasi Biryani Packaging">
      <p>The design has been made based on the functionality, aesthetics, usability, dimensions, colors, fonts and material. The functionality for this sleeve design is act as protection and display the product information. It protects from the any physical damage, moisture and dust. It also shows the information such as labelling, branding, ingredients,nutritional information which is very important for business sales and marketing. I have design this food packaging sleeve container by providing good quality of images for printing purpose and design elements to improve this product presence, easy to use and provide better handling for customer to have better grip on the food container. I have used the Icel Ultra Gothic and Helvetica to bring customer attention and details and recycle symbol show reduce the producing new raw materials for food packaging sleeve.These are below items that are used for developing this design project.</p>

      <img src="./webassests/PRINCE1.png" alt="Animated Character">
      <p>I was able to complete an animation video by using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I can develop a good effect on the animation and the video of the animation was created from the Adobe Photoshop which run the sequence of image, audio and characters motion very smooth.
        For graphics, by using Adobe Illustrator, I can create the whole character with just using geometric forms, I will using round rectangle tool, rectangle tool, eclipse tool and line segment tool. These are some examples of techniques that I apply for some body parts. By applying the same methods for images, I select the geometric tool to create the shape of the object that I intended to draw what kind of images. I also use the pathfinder in order to merge more than one shape to form any object. Then I go to window panel and click the color option to appear on the right hand side to color the background artboard. These are below items are used for developing this design project.</p>

      <img src="./webassests/robot2.jpg" alt="Multimedia Character">
      <img src="./webassests/robot3.jpg" alt="Multimedia Character">
      <p>I have created a 2D animation character using Adobe Animate. The character should be targeted at children aged 7-15 years old and must demonstrate a variety of animation techniques. I have develop a 30-second animation that showcases your character’s movements, expressions, and actions by using the keyframes, motion tweening, and shape tweening to bring the character to life. I also include sound effects or voiceovers to enhance the animation. Then, I have to export this final animation in a format that can be easily embedded into the web application. These are below items are used for developing this project design.</p>
